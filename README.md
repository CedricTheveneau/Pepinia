Cloud Campus TP Bonus - Pepinia

Pepinia is a bonus exercice given during my formation at Cloud Campus Web Dev School during the 3rd week.

This very week was about project management and working in teams on the same project.

Right at the end of it, we were given a bonus project named Pepinia, which is right here.

The goal of this project was to stay warm on HTML5/CSS3 and consolidate our skills with those languages while patiently waiting for the 4th week, which was about JS.

The project is composed of various pages. With a pretty simple layout.

Technologies used:

- HTML5
- CSS3

Framework used:

- Bootstrap5
